# About Jigsaw #

Jigsaw is a C# library that makes building programming language tools easier. For example parsers, interpreters, translators, validators, type-checkers, pretty-printers, and so on.

At the heart of Jigsaw is a PEG PackRat parsing engine. In other words it is a recursive descent parser which uses memoization. This parsing engine is the evolution of the parsing engines used in [Heron](http://www.heron-language.com) and [Cat](http://www.cat-language.com) programming languages.

Included with Jigsaw are classes which facilitate writing evaluators, pretty printers, tree transformers, and expression tree compilers.

For an introduction on how to use Jigsaw see the article [Implementing Programming Languages using C#](http://www.codeproject.com/KB/recipes/programminglanguagetoools.aspx) at CodeProject.com
